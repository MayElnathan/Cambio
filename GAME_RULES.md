# Cambio Card Game - Official Rules

## Overview
Cambio is a memory-based card game where players aim to achieve the lowest point total by strategically swapping cards and using special card abilities.

## Setup

### Players
- 2 or more players

### Initial Deal
- Each player receives **4 cards** dealt face-down
- Cards are arranged in a **2×2 grid** in front of each player
- The remaining deck is placed in the center as the **draw pile**
- One card may be placed face-up to start the **discard pile**

### Memory Phase
- Before the first player's turn, each player gets **one chance** to look at their **two closest cards** and memorize them
- After this phase, players **cannot peek** at their cards unless permitted by special card effects

## Objective
Have the **lowest point total** when the round ends.

## Card Point Values

| Card | Point Value | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Ace | 1 | Lowest numbered card |
| 2-10 | Face value | Standard point values |
| Jack | 10 | Face card |
| Queen | 10 | Face card |
| King (Black) | 10 | Has special ability |
| King (Red) | -1 | **Reduces your total** |
| Joker | 0 | Zero points |

## Turn Structure

### Basic Flow
1. **Draw Phase**: The active player draws one card from either:
   - The draw pile (deck)
   - The top card of the discard pile (variant-dependent)

2. **Action Phase**: The player chooses one of two options:
   - **Swap**: Replace one of their face-down cards with the drawn card
     - The replaced card is placed face-up on the discard pile
     - This is done to reduce point total
   - **Discard**: Place the drawn card face-up on the discard pile without swapping
     - If a special card is discarded, its effect triggers

3. **Turn End**: Play passes to the next player (typically clockwise)

## Special Card Effects

When certain cards are **played/discarded**, they trigger special abilities:

### Peek Cards
- **7 or 8**: Look at **one of your own** face-down cards
  - Helps refresh memory or learn new card positions

### Spy Cards
- **9 or 10**: Look at **one opponent's** face-down card
  - Gain information about other players' hands

### Blind Switch Cards
- **Jack or Queen**: Perform a **blind switch**
  - Swap any card with any other card **without looking**
  - Can swap your own cards or between players

### Power Card
- **Black King**: The most powerful card
  - **Look at anyone's card** (including opponents)
  - **AND switch it with one of your own cards**
  - Combines information gathering with strategic swapping

## Ending the Round

### Calling "Cambio"
- A player may call "Cambio" when they believe they have the lowest point total
- This typically triggers the end-of-round scoring

### Penalties
- If a player calls "Cambio" incorrectly (they don't have the lowest score), they may incur penalties
- Penalty rules vary by variant (agree on house rules before playing)

### Running Out of Cards
- Rules for what happens if a player discards all their cards vary by variant
- Establish house rules before starting

## Strategy Tips

### Memory Management
- The initial memory phase is crucial - remember your two closest cards
- Track which of your cards are high vs. low value
- Use peek abilities (7, 8) to refresh your memory

### Card Priority
- **Red Kings** are extremely valuable (-1 points)
- **Jokers** are safe (0 points)
- **Face cards and Black Kings** are high risk (10 points each)
- Try to swap out high-value cards when possible

### Special Card Usage
- **Black King** is the most powerful - use strategically to swap high cards
- **9 or 10** helps you know when opponents are vulnerable
- **Jack/Queen** can be used for risky but potentially rewarding blind swaps

### Timing
- Don't call "Cambio" too early - ensure you actually have the lowest total
- Pay attention to what cards opponents are discarding
- Use information from spy cards (9, 10) to gauge when to end the round

## Variants and House Rules

Since Cambio has many variants, establish these rules before playing:
- Can players draw from the discard pile or only the deck?
- What are the exact penalties for incorrect "Cambio" calls?
- What happens if a player runs out of cards?
- How many cards trigger the initial memory phase (always 2 closest)?
- Who goes first (dealer's right, youngest player, etc.)?

## Game Flow Example

1. **Setup**: 3 players, each gets 4 cards in 2×2 grid
2. **Memory**: Each player looks at their 2 closest cards
3. **Player 1**: Draws a 7, swaps it with one of their cards (discards a King)
   - The 7's effect triggers: Player 1 peeks at one of their remaining cards
4. **Player 2**: Draws from deck, gets a Red King, swaps with their card
5. **Player 3**: Draws a 9, discards it without swapping
   - The 9's effect triggers: Player 3 looks at one of Player 1's cards
6. Play continues until someone calls "Cambio"
7. All cards are revealed and points are tallied
8. Lowest score wins (or penalties applied if "Cambio" was called incorrectly)

## Edge Cases & Clarifications (Q&A)

### Special Card Effect Activation

**Q: When exactly do special card effects trigger?**

**A:** Special card effects trigger **ONLY** when you:
1. Draw a card from the **draw pile** (deck)
2. Immediately discard it to the discard pile without swapping

Effects do NOT trigger when:
- Drawing from the discard pile
- Swapping a special card from your hand
- Discarding a card that was already in your hand

---

### Black King Mechanics

**Q: Can I look at an opponent's card and then swap it with one of MY cards (without looking at mine)?**

**A:** When you play a Black King, you must:
1. **Look at up to 2 cards** (any cards from any players, if available)
2. **Then swap any 2 cards** as you like (these can be 4 different cards from the ones you looked at)

**Q: Is my card revealed to everyone when I swap it?**

**A:** No. When swapping cards, **only you see the cards**. No one else sees them. All swapped cards remain face-down.

---

### Jack/Queen Blind Switch

**Q: Can I switch two of my own cards blindly?**

**A:** Yes, you can blind switch any two cards, including two of your own.

**Q: Can I switch two opponent cards with each other?**

**A:** Yes, you can blind switch any two cards in play, including cards between opponents.

**Q: Are the switched cards revealed or do they stay face-down?**

**A:** The cards stay **face-down**. It's a blind switch - no one sees the cards.

---

### Calling "Cambio"

**Q: What if two players want to call "Cambio" on the same round?**

**A:** You can call "Cambio" **only at the start of your turn** (before drawing). Only one person can call it (the first person to call).

**Q: Does the first person to call it end the round immediately?**

**A:** No. When you call "Cambio":
1. You **finish your turn immediately** (you do NOT draw a card)
2. All other players get **one more turn each**
3. Then all cards are revealed and scored

**Q: Can someone else call "Cambio" to challenge?**

**A:** No. Once "Cambio" is called, no other player can call it.

---

### Tied Scores

**Q: What happens if multiple players have the same lowest score?**

**A:** 
- The person who **called "Cambio" loses the tie**
- If 2+ people who **didn't call "Cambio"** have the same lowest score, **they both win**

---

### Empty Deck

**Q: What happens when the draw pile runs out?**

**A:** **Reshuffle the discard pile** to create a new draw pile.

---

### Drawing from Discard Pile

**Q: Can players draw a special card from the discard pile and immediately use its effect?**

**A:** No. When you draw from the discard pile:
- You can **only replace it with one of your cards**
- **No special effects activate**
- You **cannot do anything else** on that turn (no discarding without swapping)

**Q: Does drawing from discard count as "playing" that card?**

**A:** No. Drawing from the discard pile is purely for swapping into your hand. Effects only trigger when drawn from the draw pile and immediately discarded.

---

### Red King & Negative Scores

**Q: Can your total score go negative?**

**A:** **Yes**. Red Kings give -1 points each, so your score can go below zero.

Example: 2 Red Kings (-2) + Joker (0) + Ace (1) = **-1 total score**

---

### Initial Memory Phase

**Q: Which are the "two closest cards" in the 2×2 grid?**

**A:** The **bottom two cards** (closest to you physically).

```
[Top Left]    [Top Right]
[Bottom Left] [Bottom Right] ← These two closest cards
```

---

### Swapping Mechanics During Turn

**Q: Do I choose which of my 4 cards to replace before or after looking at the drawn card?**

**A:** **After** looking at the drawn card. The sequence is:
1. Draw a card
2. Look at it
3. Decide whether to swap it with one of your face-down cards or discard it

**Q: Can I look at my face-down cards before deciding?**

**A:** **No**. You cannot peek at your face-down cards unless a special card effect allows it.

**Q: Is the swap mandatory if I drew from the deck?**

**A:** **No**. You can choose to:
- Swap the drawn card with one of your cards, OR
- Discard it to the discard pile (triggering its effect if it's a special card)

---

### Special Card Stacking

**Q: If I discard a 7, peek at my card, and it's another 7 - can I immediately swap it and trigger another peek?**

**A:** No. You can discard the second 7 to the discard pile, but you **cannot activate its effect** because:
- Effects only trigger when drawn from the **draw pile** and immediately discarded
- The second 7 came from your hand, not the draw pile

Effects trigger **once per turn maximum**, and only from draw pile → discard pile.

**Note**: This implementation should follow these core rules while allowing for configuration of variant-specific behaviors.
